I would like to present you my program - LanTransfer written in Python with PyQt as a GUI library.

LanTransfer works like a streaming service, while one host (server) selects file and clicks "stream" then
the other host (recipient) is just typing ip of server and is clicking "download". If file is sent then server
is sending MD5 checksum which is compared to MD5 generated by recipient.

Have fun!

Protocol description:

UploadProcess after start is waiting for these commands (as a binary sequence, it is decoded to UTF-8 by server):

-> b'name please', server returns file name

-> b'size please', server returns size of file (DownloadProcess has to know when to stop reading bytes)

-> b'file please', server starts stream of bytes to save by DownloadProcess

It has to be sent in this order.

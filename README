I would like to present you my program - LanTransfer written in Python with PyQt as a GUI library.

LanTransfer works like a streaming service, while one host (server) selects file and clicks "stream" then
the other host (recipient) is just typing ip of server and is clicking "download". If file is sent then server
is sending MD5 checksum which is compared to MD5 generated by recipient.

Have fun!
